**Milestone 2 Reflections**

The prototype for our Data Science Job Compensation Dashboard has been developed for Milestone 2 and is accessible at [dsci-532-2024-7-ds-compensation.onrender.com](dsci-532-2024-7-ds-compensation.onrender.com). This tool is crafted to facilitate initial explorations into data science compensation for data science job seekers.

The prototype meets our primary objective found in our milestone 1 report, while allowing room for future improvements to the user interface, informed by future analysis and user feedback.

Our dashboard successfully presents data on salary distributions by region, various roles within the data sector (such as data scientists, data analysts, ML engineers, data engineers, etc.), company sizes, industries, and the interplay between these factors for comparative analyses.

The prototype features four widgets depicting: Salary by Experience Level, Average Salary by Job Title, Salary Distribution, and Salary by Company Location. A control panel on the left allows for the application of universal filters across all graphs, including currency type and company size.

**Deviations From the Milestone 1 Sketch**

The deviations include the exclusion of a heat map for the Salary Distribution widget and the non-implementation of buttons and sliders on the control panel. We also omitted the filter for remote ratio. These differences were driven by a focus on time efficiency. From the work implementing the first half of the dashboard, we developed competency in developing drop down menus and buttons, which were deemed adequate for achieving the prototype's primary objective. Attempts to render the Salary Distribution as a heat map encountered bugs that proved time-consuming to resolve. Opting for simplicity, we scaled back to ensure the delivery of a functional minimal viable product (MVP), with plans to refine our dashboard based on feedback.

**Future Improvements**

Subsequent updates will introduce significant cosmetic visual enhancements to the graphs to adhere to the best practices in data visualization, as outlined in courses like DSCI 531 at UBC. Modifications will include standardized axis labeling conventions, a revised color palette for clarity (blue and purple blend together), and an explanatory legend for employment types (expand abbreviations).

We may add additional global filters for grouping company location by Continent , Remote Ratio and Company Size. We may add additional graphs depicting Avg Salary vs Remote Ratio and Avg Salary vs Experience Level. We may add a world map coloured by Avg Salary. We will brainstorm ways to display graphs very low sample sizes when multiple filters are selected. Perhaps a display warning? More brainstorming is needed to analyze if these modifications are worth making.

We eagerly anticipate feedback from initial users to refine our dashboard, with a commitment to the principles of iterative design.
