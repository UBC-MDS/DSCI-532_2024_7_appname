# Data Science Job Compensation Dashboard

Our role: MDS Career Advising Assistant

Target audience: MDS Students

As the Master of Data Science program approaches the end, we understand the immense stress students might feel exploring career opportunities while juggling academic challenges. Career exploration is a critical component of our life journey, yet the scope can be vast, making it overwhelming and time-consuming for many of us. If we could understand the variability in compensation levels across different geographical locations and the character of companies, we could unload one of the criteria students have to explore- salary. We propose building a dashboard where students can explore different factors impacting the salary they expect to receive. We aim that our tool can serve as an initial exploration tool to narrow their job search effort based on the kind of lifestyle and compensation levels students wish to achieve. Our dashboard will display the distribution of income by region, type of roles around data (data scientist, data analyst, ML engineer, Data engineer etc.), the size of the company, the industry the company is in, and the intersections of two factors for students to filter and compare.


## Research Question & Scenario Example

With the Data Science Job Compensation Dashboard, MDS students have another useful tool to navigate job application challengs. By providing access to world wide data on compensation, company types, and job roles, our dashboard allows students to investigate research questions they may have on the industry that will aid them in finding the best role suited for their goals.

To illustrate, let's explore a practical example of how this tool can be useful for a hypothetical MDS graduate named Joel. Joel's story will highlight the dashboard's functionality and its value in making informed decisions about his future in the data science field.

Joel, an MDS graduate specializing in data visualization, uses the Data Science Job Compensation Dashboard to guide his job search. He starts by [comparing] salaries across different cities, using the dashboard to [visualize] compensation trends worldwide. Interested in tech and finance sectors, Joel [filters] job roles to Data Analyst and Visualization Specialist, paying close attention to industries with competitive pay.

He then explores how company size affects salaries and job satisfaction, discovering that mid-sized tech firms offer the balance he seeks between compensation and a collaborative environment. The Skills and Technologies section indicates he might be served improving a high in demand skill with high paying data science jobs, prompting him to consider an extra advanced machine learning course to boost his profile.

With these new insights, Joel focuses his applications on mid-sized companies in cities where the salary supports a high quality of life. This targeted approach, informed by the dashboard, enables Joel to navigate the job market strategically, aligning his career aspirations with market realities.
